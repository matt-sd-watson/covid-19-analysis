covid-19-analysis-r provides comprehensive data visualizations of country-specific case numbers and
death rates using RStudio with geographic mapping. 
covid-19-widget creates an interactive widget using Python & bokeh to visualize daily case numbers
for each country where covid-19 cases have been recorded.  

Note: Figures generated through r-plotly or bokeh and do not render
in Jupyter offline mode. Their code, however, is recorded in
the respective notebook.
