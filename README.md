# covid-19-analysis
Jupyter notebooks of exploratory covid-19 public dataset analysis. Data were retrieved on 
from April 9, 2020 from the Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset public repository hosted on Kaggle:

Note: The two external .png figures for the pie chart of top cases and 
timeline of infection recordings were generated with plotly and do not render
in the Jupter notebook. Their code, however, is recorded there.
