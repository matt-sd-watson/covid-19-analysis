covid-19-analysis-r provides comprehensive data visualizations of country-specific case numbers and
death rates using RStudio with geographic mapping. 
covid-19-widget creates an interactive widget using Python & bokeh to visualize daily case numbers
for each country where covid-19 cases have been recorded.  

Note: The two external .png figures for the pie chart of top cases and 
timeline of infection recordings were generated with r-plotly and do not render
in offline mode within the R Jupter notebook. Their code, however, is recorded there.
